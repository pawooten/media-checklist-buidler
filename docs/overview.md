Mobile app requires the user to take one photo to commemorate the event. If physical media was used, the user may decide to photograph the game or movie case, or perhaps a screen from the media such as the end credits, final high score results of a game, or something which is otherwise meaningful to the user will be selected.

Future phases:
- allow more than one photo type (screen images and physical media)
- allow multiple photo of the same picture type - user would likely need to designate a primary photo
- allow custom photo types
- allow video or audio recordings

Mobile app requires the user to specify a date for the event, the UI must default to the current date. Mobile app should also display the three most recent events, to help users avoid accidentally creating duplicate events.

Future phases:
- customizable number of recent events to display, including disabling the display of recent events

Mobile app requires the user to label the media, which will likely be the title of the media.

Future phases:
- explore options for reverse image search to list media label suggestions
- spell check for media label

Mobile app allows the user to specify a note.

Mobile app populates a json based local file store of the cataloged media. Mobile app generates lists of media chronologically.

For video games, it would be nice to be able to group media (games) by console. This might be useful for other media, for instance, if a user wanted to generate a list of their favorite films and group by genre.

Future phases:
- cloud stored user data?
